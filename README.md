## Election-Audit SUmmary
The tools used, such as Python and Visual Studio code, allowed us process a large data set related to election in the most accurate way, while being efficient
with time to proivde the anlaysis that was required for the committe. The script can be used for future elections, not only in the counties listed above, but in any 
county across the nation, where processing and analysis of an election data is required. It gives the breakdown by count and percentage for both candidates and the 
counties which helps to see what county has contributed the most or had the most impact to the election since it was a strong win on behlaf of Dina DeGette. It will
help the election committe to take new approach to the election to ensure everyone voice is being heard.
